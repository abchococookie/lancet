## Introduction{.smaller}
#### Background
- high-intensity statin -> intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol concentration
- **drug combination** show greater efficacy and lower risks than increasing doses of one drug
  - Ezetimibe: inhibits cholesterol absorption and increases clearance of cholesterol from the blood

## Introduction{.smaller}
#### Obejctive
- to compare **3-year** clinical efficacy and safety of **moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy** versus high-intensity statin monotherapy in patients who are at very high risk for cardiovascular diseases

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Study Design
- Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label study
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
method_table <- data.frame(
  CombinationGroup = c("rosuvastatin 10mg + ezetimibe 10mg"),
  MonoGroup = c("rosuvastatin 20mg")
)
row.names(method_table) <- c("therapy")

knitr::kable(method_table)
```
- endpoint: 3-year
- in the ITT population with NI margin of 2.0%

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Participants
- Participants: patients with ASCVD requiring achievement of LDL-C concentrations of less than 70mg/dL
  - revious myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, history of coronary revascularisation or other arterial revascularisation procedures, ischaemic stroke, or peripheral artery disease (PAD)


## Methods{.smaller}
#### Procedures
- Procedures: maintenance of the initial dose was strongly recommended

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Outcomes
- Primary endpoint:the occurrence of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events, or non-fatal stroke within 3 years
- Secondary endpoint: clinical efficacy and safety
  - Efficacy endpoint: proportion of participants whose LDL-C concentration are reduced to less than 70mg/dL at 1, 2, and 3-years 
  - Safety endpoint: discontinuation or dose reduction of study medication caused by intolerance and the occurrence of clinical adverse events
  
## Methods{.smaller}
#### Sample Size
- Primary objective: 1605 patients were required for each group considering a 5% one-side alpha error rate and 80% power
- Secondary objective: 220 patients were required for each group considering a 5% two-sided alpha error rate and 80% power

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Statistical Analysis
1. Kaplan-Merier method: time-to-event analysis
2. Log-rank test: event rates btw two groups
3. Cox proportional hazard regression model: HRs with 95% CI
- NI for the primary endpoint: upper CI for the difference in the incidence of the primary endpoint btw  two groups was less than 2.0% = NI declared
- log-rank tests for the secondary endpoint
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
population_table <- data.frame(
  primary = c("O", "X"),
  sensitivity = c("X", "O"),
  safety = c("X", "O")

### description
- baseline characteristics: not statistically different
- 95.8% of total completed a 3-year follow up
- other cardiovascular medication: not statistically different

#### Primary endpoint

## Results{.smaller}
#### Primary endpoint
- post-hoc analysis
  - upper limit of one-sided 97.5% CI of the diff was 1.13%: met the NI margin(02.69 to 1.13)

## Results{.smaller}
#### Primary endpoint
- sensitivity analysis
  - primary endpoint occured in 9.1% of combi group, 9.4% of mono group
  - post-hoc upper limit of one-sided 97.5% CI of the diff in primary endpoiont was 1.69%: met NI margin of 2.0%(95% CI: -2.28 to 1.69)

#### Secondary endpoints

#### Secondary endpoints
- post-hoc analysis: LDL-C concentration of less than 55mf/dL

## Discussion{.smaller}
#### Conclusion
1. patients with ASCVD - combination therapy was NI to monotherapy for the 3-year
2. NI was achieved with (1) a higher proportion of LDL-C concentration of less than 70mg/dL and (2) a lower prevalence of discontinuation or dose reduction caused by intolerance to the study drug
- patients with high risk cardiovascular diseases - combination therapy also achieve greater efficacy and lower risks
- addition of ezetimibe expected to reduce the risk of adverse effects
- dyslipidaemia guidelines - (1) less than 55mg/dL (2) at least 50% from baseline

## Discussion{.smaller}
#### Importance
1. reduced statin does
2. Long-term and Large num of patients - in previous studies: 24 weeks, 891 patients
3. Clinical primary endpoint

## Discussion{.smaller}
#### Limitation
1. Open-label study -> necebo effect
2. Lower than anticipated event rates -> NI margin of 2.0% allowed for a more generous CI
3. Small num of events -> comparison of the individual clinical outcomes of the primary endpoint might be difficult
